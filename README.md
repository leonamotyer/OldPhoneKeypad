Thank you for taking the time to view my code! I am very excited to learn! I look forward to hearing from you!

This project accepts an input and will split each char into a foreach variable. 
then each variable is tested weather or not the empty variable LastKey is = /0 if it not the char is stored in that variable and the counter is increased.
it will itterate through that loop unti theres a different char and then it will select the corresponding char from the dictionary at the index of the count.
It then prints that to the screen!
